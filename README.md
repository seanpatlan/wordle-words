# Wordle Words

Repo with the two lists of words used by the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Both lists are contained in CSV files storing the words in one long column.

- *valid-words.csv* is a list of all words that Wordle considers a valid guess (12,972 words)
- *word-bank.csv* is the list of words that Wordle selects the daily word from (2,315 words)

These lists are accurate as of 2/7/22, but probably won't be once NYT officially takes over the game.
